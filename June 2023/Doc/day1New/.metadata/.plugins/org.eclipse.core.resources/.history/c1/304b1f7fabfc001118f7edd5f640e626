To Begin with we will start with a small example on how to use the IOC container provided by Spring Framework. 

In this example we look at setter based injection.

Dependency Injection primarily means that an object depends on another object for which we
might have to write some piece of code for initialization which we will now delegate it to
the container. All dependencies for a particular bean are mentioned in an XML file by
default.

The Spring container basically represents an instance of BeanFactory and any of its sub-interfaces.
Please check the API documentation on the same.

Also we will discuss about the difference in configuration between Spring 1.x and Spring 2.x

What happens when the container loads?

1) Initializes itself (internal services for ex: event service)
2) Loads configuration file(s)
3) Parse bean definitions, verify dependencies between beans and resolve circular references to avoid 
   runtime bottlenecks.
4) Instantiate singleton beans and dependent ones too.
5) Ready to GO!
